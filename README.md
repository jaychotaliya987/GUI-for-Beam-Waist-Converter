# GUI for Beam Waist Converter

This was the project I was assigned in the University of Kassel in the course "Ultra Short Laser Pulses".

This is a open source project and one can use and modify this at will. 

In this Project I converted diffrent Gaussian Beam profiles like FWHM(full width half max), $1/e^2$
and RMS(root mean square value). You enter a number for any one of the beam profile and it gives the values for other 2.

That is all for now, Suggestions are very welcome. I am planning to improve this. I want to put a graph
to show diffrent values in a gaussian distribution to better understand how each value looks in comparision.

In 1.2 Beam Waist Converter I have included graph for referance and also tweaked UI for better. I think it looks much better now.
There is some conversion factor error that I have to fix but other than that it is working pretty good.
